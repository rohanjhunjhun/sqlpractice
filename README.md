# SQL Practice Repository

This repository is a collection of SQL problems and solutions where I document my learnings and practice SQL concepts. The purpose of this repository is to enhance my understanding of SQL by solving problems of varying difficulty levels, ranging from Easy to Hard.

## Structure
- **Easy Problems**: Beginner-friendly problems to build foundational skills.
- **Medium Problems**: Intermediate-level problems to strengthen SQL knowledge.
- **Hard Problems**: Advanced problems to master complex SQL queries and concepts.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a personal learning journal and a reference for SQL problem-solving techniques. It is organized to help track progress and revisit concepts as needed.

## Future Plans
- **SQL Plans and Query Optimization**: Explore and analyze SQL execution plans and optimization techniques using BigQuery public datasets.
- **Further Projects**: Undertake additional projects to apply SQL in real-world scenarios and deepen understanding.
